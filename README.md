I conceptualized and executed a comprehensive Vehicle Rental System website, showcasing my expertise in both front-end and back-end development. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I meticulously designed a user-friendly and responsive UI, prioritizing an optimal user experience. On the back-end, I employed Java to create a secure and efficient system, implementing APIs structured under the MVC pattern to ensure a well-organized and scalable architecture. Engaging collaboratively within a team environment, we successfully met project milestones and collectively delivered a high-quality product. My commitment to excellence extended to rigorous testing and debugging procedures, guaranteeing the optimal performance and reliability of the Vehicle Rental System.
